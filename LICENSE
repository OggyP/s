1. The copy made, if identical, is maintained to ensure it is up to the date with the original.
This applies for HTML / CSS / Javascript copied. If the copier does not intend to keep maintaining the website he should remove the copy/clone/fork, if the original site is still running.
2. Permission has been sought from the owner of the software before publication. This applies to the use of the CSS and Javascript files only. The HTML folder structure can be copied without permission. However the copier must seek approval to replicate the entire site exactly in its current form . Approval will most likely be granted if sought.
3. This license to copy the entire website as is, only applies to copies made from 01/03/2019 onwards. Copies made prior to 01/03/2019 are in breach of copyright.
