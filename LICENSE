** Update 2019-03-01 - This license to copy only applies to copies made from 01/03/2019 onwards.

* The copy made, if identical, is maintained to ensure it is up to the date with the original.
This applies for HTML / Javascript copied. If the user does not intend to keep maintaining the website he should remove the copy/clone/fork, if the original site is still running.
* Permission has been sought from the owner. This applies to the use of the CSS and Javascript files only. The HTML folder structure can be copied without permission required. However the user must seek approval to scraper/replicate the entire site exactly. Approval will most likely be granted if sought.

Copies made prior to 01/03/2019 are in breach of copyright. 

*** Update 2022-01-06 - Creating a fork on Github does not consistute a breach of copyright, I don't mind resharing code. In order to publishing the content to Github Pages is to submit to the above copy conditions, since technically you are cloning the original. This applies to the "s" repo.
